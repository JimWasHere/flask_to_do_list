# flask_to_do_list
Simple to do list Flask app

This is a very simple to do list Flask app. It is written in Python and uses an sqlite database to store to do items as well as Bootstrap for styling.

Future upgrades will be: 
   * Use a Postgres database 
   * Add functionality for multiple users 
   * Allow users to save multiple lists 
   * Allow admin users to assign tasks to others 
   * Keep track of supplies and inventory.
   * Add calander functionality
   * Add text or email reminders of items to be done
   * Integrate sub-items and allow collaboration on items
   

ReadMe will be updated as changes progress.
